        <br>
        Burundi might look like a small speck on a map, but because it's so densely populated it's home to many people. Ravaged by <font color="#5a92df">civil war, massacre, and genocide,</font> the people of Burundi have had it rough. Two thirds of the population live in poverty, existing on <font color="#5a92df">less than $1 a day</font>.</div>

    <header>About Turame</header>
        <br>
        <br>
            Making a difference can be difficult, and sometimes helping people half-way around the world seems impossible. Fortunately, there is an organization called <font color="#99771c">Turame </font>that was founded to help fight poverty in Burundi. Turame raises money to finance micro-loans for impoverished families, widows, and refugees. Rather than give the money away, Turame works with loan recipients to form lasting investments, to build small businesses, and to teach self-sufficiency.

        <br>
        To spread awareness and raise funds, we (a West Michigan youth group) have decided to hold a 24-hour gaming marathon. Friends, family, and community members are welcome to come play games in exchange for small donations. We're going to try to stream out a live video, so anyone can join us in spirit -- feel free to donate online as well! All funds raised will be donated to Turame.
